# Peer-2-Peer-messaging-app
Simple text file and message exchange over same wifi network.
We've built up the app in android platform with android studio(For the extra mark of course :P). The programming language we've used is java. 
The app is based upon java socket programming. All the base features such as input fields to provide ip and port of the counterpart android device, 
messaging, sending textual file, saving conversations, changing background that affects both sides are implemented. Some extra features are also implemented.
